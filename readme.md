MtGOX API v2 Node Example

This is node.js example for using Mt.GOX's HTTP API v2.

To use, you must have already created an API Key on their website.
If you haven't already done so, go to: https://mtgox.com/security

In this example, once you input your API Key and Secret, the client will output
your recent transactions.  

Credit for excellent API v2 documentation goes to nitrous:

Read the above documentation to find out how to perform other actions.

This is based completely and utterly on the Node.js example found on the bitcoin wiki:

Stay tuned for a more complete API v2 client in the future...
